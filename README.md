# International Debt Data Analysis with Postgresql

This is an an ehibition of my skills in using Postgres SQL to interact with a relational database. 

The data used in this project is provided by [The World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/). It contains both national and regional debt statistics for several countries across the globe as recorded from 1970 to 2015.

The sql queries were run in jupyter notebook.

Now, grab some popcorn and let's [EXPLORE]() :smile: .
